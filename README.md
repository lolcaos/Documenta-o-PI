# Comida Justa — Fair Food

<span style="color:blue">Comida Justa is a social-impact web app that connects food surplus sources (markets, restaurants) with organizations and people in need, reducing food waste while increasing food security and transparency.</span>

## 1. Project Presentation

**Problem:** A large amount of perfectly edible food is wasted because there is no efficient connection between those who have surplus (restaurants, markets, bakeries) and those who need it (NGOs, community kitchens, vulnerable families). This causes environmental, social and economic harm.

**Solution:** Fair Food provides a simple, trusted platform to:
- Publish available surplus (donation or symbolic-price sale).  
- Match donors with nearby recipients or NGOs.  
- Track donations to ensure transparency and reduce waste.  

This project supports Sustainable Development goal by facilitating access to safe, nutritious food for vulnerable people.
